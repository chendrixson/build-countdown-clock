# build-countdown-clock
Code and meshes from my "Microsoft Countdown Clock" Arduino build video.

These are the exact parts I used, but similar substitutions will work:
* [Display](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805735592382.html)
* [Arduino Nano](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0713XK923)
* [USBC Charging Module](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804563563538.htm)
* [18650 Battery](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805429494174.html)

In the future I'll add a [RealTimeClock Module](https://www.amazon.com/AITRIP-Precision-AT24C32-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B09KPC8JZQ) to make this more accurate, and handle power loss.
